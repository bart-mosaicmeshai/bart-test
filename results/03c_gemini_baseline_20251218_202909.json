I\u2019m feeling like a total Sigma. I\u2019ve been mewing all day, jawline sharp, coding streak on \ud83d\udcaf. My pull request? It has W rizz. The code is looking majestic. No bugs, just straight gas. \u26fd\ufe0f\n\nMy PM, let\u2019s call him \"Gary\" (total NPC energy), slides into my DMs and says, *\"Hey, maybe we wait until Monday?\"*\n\nI look at the screen. I look at the merge button. And I think: **Nah, I\u2019d win.** \ud83d\uddff\n\nI reply, \"Gary, stop yapping. Let him cook.\" \ud83c\udf73\n\nI hit **Merge**. Then I hit **Deploy to Prod**. I literally yeet the code into the AWS cloud like it\u2019s nothing. I\u2019m thinking I\u2019m about to clock out and go touch grass, maybe get a boba. \ud83e\uddcb\n\n**5:01 PM**\nThe CI/CD pipeline turns green. I\u2019m glazing myself. I\u2019m literally the main character.\n\n**5:03 PM**\nPagerDuty starts tweaking. \ud83d\udea8 My phone vibrates. Then it vibrates again. Then it starts screaming like it just drank the Grimace Shake.\n\nI check the logs. It\u2019s giving\u2026 Ohio. \ud83c\udf3d\n\n**5:05 PM**\nThe latency just got Fanum Taxed. We are talking 500 errors everywhere. The database is skibidi-ing out of control. CPU usage is mogging the memory limits. It\u2019s not even a memory leak; it\u2019s a memory flood. \ud83c\udf0a\ud83d\udc80\n\nI check the console.\n`Uncaught Exception: undefined is not a function.`\n\nBro, **WHAT?** I literally tested this locally. It worked on my machine, no cap! \ud83e\udde2 My local environment was serving looks, but Production is acting mad sus. It\u2019s the imposter. \ud83d\udd2a\n\n**5:10 PM**\nGary DMs me: *\"Is the site down? Customers are tweeting.\"*\n\nI start sweating. My mewing streak is broken. My cortisol is high key maxing out. I\u2019m typing `kubectl get pods` so fast my keyboard is smoking.\n\nI realize the issue. I forgot to add the environment variable for the API key. \ud83e\udd21 I literally deployed a feature that needs a key that doesn\u2019t exist. I have negative IQ. I have L rizz.\n\n**5:15 PM**\nI try to hotfix it.\n*Git commit -m \"fixed the oopsie\"*\n*Git push --force* (We ball).\n\nThe pipeline is moving slower than a tortoise in molasses. It\u2019s actually edging me right now. \ud83d\udc22\n\n**5:25 PM**\nThe CTO joins the Zoom war room. He\u2019s not speaking. He\u2019s just staring. He\u2019s mogging me through the webcam. The silence is loud. I know I\u2019m about to get sent to the backrooms. \ud83d\udeaa\ud83c\udfc3\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\n**5:30 PM**\nThe rollback finally hits. The site comes back up. The 500 errors stop. The database stops having a panic attack.\n\nI sit back in my chair. I am absolutely cooked. Deep fried. Burnt to a crisp. \ud83c\udf57\n\nGary messages: *\"Let's do a post-mortem on Monday.\"*\n\nTranslation: I\u2019m getting fired. \ud83d\udcc9\n\n**Moral of the story:** Don\u2019t deploy on Friday unless you want your weekend to be skibidi toilet trash. Just wait for Monday. No cap. \u270c\ufe0f\u26b0\ufe0f",
