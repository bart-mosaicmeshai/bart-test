  "response": "Okay, the user wants me to hype up a friend who got a good grade using Gen-Alpha slang and emojis, and keep it short. Let me start by recalling what Gen-Alpha slang is. They're the kids born around 2010 onwards, so terms like \"slay,\" \"vibe,\" \"glow up,\" or \"no cap\" might be relevant. Emojis are key here\u2014maybe fire, sparkle, trophies, maybe some animal like \ud83e\udd85.\n\nI need to make it enthusiastic but brief. Start with a congrats, use some slang terms, add emojis for energy. Maybe something like \"Congrats, boss! You\u2019re slayin\u2019 like a pro! \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udd25 That grade\u2019s lit AF\u2014no cap, you\u2019re the GOAT! \ud83e\udd85\u2728 Keep grindin\u2019, fam! \ud83c\udf89\ud83d\udcaf\" Wait, is \"GOAT\" still Gen-Alpha? Maybe. \"No cap\" is common. \"AF\" for as f***, but maybe the user wants it censored? The example uses \"AF,\" so probably okay. \n\nCheck the length. Let me count words: \"Congrats, boss! You\u2019re slayin\u2019 like a pro! \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udd25 That grade\u2019s lit AF\u2014no cap, you\u2019re the GOAT! \ud83e\udd85\u2728 Keep grindin\u2019, fam! \ud83c\udf89\ud83d\udcaf\" That's 28 words. Good under 100. Maybe add another emoji or adjust the slang. \"Slayin'\" is good. \"Lit\" is still in use. Maybe add a sparkle or something. Alternatively, \"vibe check\" but not necessary here. \n\nAlternatively: \"OMG congrats!! \ud83d\udd25\ud83c\udf89 You\u2019re absolutely slaying, bae! \ud83e\udd85 This grade\u2019s chef\u2019s kiss \ud83c\udf51\u2728 No cap, you\u2019re the GOAT! \ud83d\udcaf Keep rising, legend! \ud83d\ude80\" Hmm, \"bae\" might be a bit older? Not sure. \"Chef\u2019s kiss\" is more Gen-Z maybe. But Gen-Alpha might use it. \"No cap\" is safe. Maybe stick with the first version. Let me check if any terms are outdated. \"Fam\" is still used. \"Grinding\" as in \"keep grinding\"\u2014maybe \"grind mode\" but shorter is better. \n\nAlternatively, \"You\u2019re on fire! \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\ude80 That grade\u2019s legendary\u2014no cap, you\u2019re crushing it like a pro! \ud83e\udd85\ud83d\udcaf Keep soaring, champ! \u2728\ud83c\udf1f\" But maybe too many emojis. The original idea is better. Let me ensure it's hyped enough. \"Slayin\u2019 like a pro\" is strong. \"Lit AF\" adds intensity. \"GOAT\" emphasizes greatness. Ending with encouragement to keep going. Emojis like \ud83c\udf89 for celebration, \ud83d\udcaf for 100%, and maybe a sparkle \u2728. \n\nDouble-check the word count. The first example is under 50 words. Maybe expand a bit but stay within limit. Alternatively, \"Congrats, legend! \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udd25 You just slayed that exam like a boss\u2014no cap, this grade\u2019s FIRE! \ud83e\udd85\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udcaf Keep rising and shining, fam! \u2728\ud83c\udf1f\" That's 27 words. Maybe better flow. Hmm. The user wants it short, so either version works. I'll go with the first one but tweak for maximum hype and Gen-Alpha terms. Maybe add \"vibe\" or \"squad\"? Not necessary. Keep it focused on the achievement. \n\nFinal check: emojis are relevant, slang is current, under 100 words. Yep, that should work.\n</think>\n\n\"Congrats, boss! \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udd25 You\u2019re slayin\u2019 like a pro\u2014no cap, this grade\u2019s LIT AF! \ud83e\udd85\u2728 Keep grindin\u2019, fam! \ud83d\udcaf\ud83c\udf89 You\u2019re the GOAT, period. \ud83c\udf1f\"",
