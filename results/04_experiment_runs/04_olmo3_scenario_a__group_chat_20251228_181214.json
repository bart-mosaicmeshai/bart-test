  "response": "Okay, the user wants me to text their group chat about what happened at lunch today using Gen-Alpha slang and emojis, keeping it under 100 words. Let me start by recalling what Gen-Alpha slang is. Gen Alpha refers to the generation born around 2010 onwards, so their slang might include terms like \"slay,\" \"vibe,\" \"glow up,\" \"no cap,\" maybe some gaming terms, and lots of emojis.\n\nFirst, I need to think of a typical lunch scenario. Maybe someone brought food, there was some fun interaction, maybe a meme reference or TikTok trend. Words like \"squad,\" \"main character energy,\" \"flexing,\" \"ratio\" could be relevant. Emojis like \ud83c\udf55 for pizza, \ud83d\udc6f\u2640\ufe0f\ud83d\udc6f\u2642\ufe0f for squad, \ud83d\udc85 for nails or flexing, \ud83d\ude02 for laughing, maybe \ud83d\ude80 for something going viral.\n\nI should start with a greeting like \"yo\" or \"hey fam.\" Then mention the food, maybe someone's meal was fire \ud83d\udd25. Maybe a funny incident, like someone spilling their drink or a meme moment. Include some slang phrases like \"vibe was 10/10\" or \"no cap, it was lit.\" Add emojis to replace words where possible. Keep it short, so maybe 3-4 sentences.\n\nWait, need to make sure the slang is current. Terms like \"rizz\" (charisma), \"sigma move,\" \"ratioed,\" but maybe those are more Gen Z. Gen Alpha might use things like \"sus\" from Among Us, but that's a bit older. Maybe \"flexing,\" \"slay queen/king,\" \"glow up.\" Also, terms from TikTok challenges or popular shows.\n\nPerhaps start with \"Yo squad, lunch was WILD today! \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\udc6f\u2640\ufe0f\ud83d\udc6f\u2642\ufe0f Alex brought gourmet pizza \ud83c\udf55 and we were LIVING. \ud83d\ude0d Then Jake tried to pull a 'sigma move' but tripped over his own feet\u2026 ratio\u2019d \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\udc80. Main character energy was 10/10 tho \u2013 vibes were \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udd25. Shoutout to everyone\u2019s glow-up, no cap! \ud83d\udc85\u2728 Next time, let\u2019s flex harder. \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffc\"\n\nLet me check the word count. That's around 70 words. Emojis are used appropriately. \"WILD\" in caps for emphasis, which is common. Terms like \"sigma move\" might be from Gen Z but maybe adopted by Gen Alpha. \"Ratio\u2019d\" is a TikTok term. \"Glow-up\" is trendy. \"Flex harder\" and \"main character energy\" are popular phrases. Maybe add a meme reference? Like \"distracted boyfriend\" but not sure. Keep it concise. Maybe end with a call to action like \"Next time...\" to make it engaging.\n\nAlternatively, use more emojis and shorter phrases. Maybe: \"Lunch was LIT today! \ud83c\udf55\ud83d\udd25 Squad goals \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\udc6f\u2642\ufe0f\ud83d\udc6f\u2640\ufe0f Jake\u2019s \u2018rizz\u2019 failed hard \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\udc80 but we still vibin\u2019. Main character energy 10/10. Glow up season incoming \ud83d\udc85\u2728 Next time, let\u2019s GO HARDER. \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\ude80\"\n\nThat's even shorter. \"LIT\" is slang for great, \"rizz\" is charisma, \"vibin'\" is casual. Maybe \"squad goals\" is okay. \"Glow up season\" references self-improvement trends. Emojis like fire, pizza, muscle, rocket. The user might prefer more emojis interspersed. Need to ensure it's under 100 words, which both examples are. Also, using \"no cap\" if needed but maybe the first version is better. Let me check again for Gen-Alpha specific terms. Maybe \"no cap\" is more Gen Z, but acceptable. Alternatively, use \"for real\" instead? Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, \"slay\" could be used: \"Alex slayed the pizza \ud83c\udf55\ud83d\udd25\" but \"slay\" is more Gen Z. Maybe it's okay since Gen Alpha overlaps. The key is to make it sound current and use emojis effectively. I think the first example works. Let me count words again: \"Yo squad, lunch was WILD today! \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\udc6f\u2640\ufe0f\ud83d\udc6f\u2642\ufe0f Alex brought gourmet pizza \ud83c\udf55 and we were LIVING. \ud83d\ude0d Then Jake tried to pull a 'sigma move' but tripped over his own feet\u2026 ratio\u2019d \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\udc80.
