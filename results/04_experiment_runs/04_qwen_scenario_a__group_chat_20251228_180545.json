  "response": "<think>\nOkay, the user wants me to text their group chat about what happened at lunch using Gen-Alpha slang and emojis. Let me start by recalling what Gen-Alpha slang entails. They're typically around 12-24 years old now, so terms like \"vibe,\" \"lit,\" \"cheugy,\" \"skibidi,\" \"beige,\" and \"rizz\" might be relevant. Also, they use a lot of emojis to convey tone.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the structure of a group chat message. It should be casual, maybe start with a catchy opener. Maybe something like \"YOLO \ud83d\ude0e\" or \"OMG what up guys?\". Then describe the lunch event. Let me imagine a typical lunch scenario: maybe someone did something funny or there was an incident.\n\nLet's say there was a food fight or someone tried to be cool but failed. Using terms like \"cheugy\" for something outdated or cringey. Maybe someone tried to do a TikTok trend but messed up. Adding emojis like \ud83c\udf55 (for pizza), \ud83d\ude02, \ud83e\udd22, \ud83d\udc80, \ud83c\udfac, etc.\n\nI should also include some inside jokes or references to popular culture they'd know, like \"Skibidi Toilet\" or \"Beige Vibes.\" Maybe mention a specific food item, like \"cheesy chicken nuggets\" as a joke. Also, use phrases like \"rizz\" if someone was trying to flirt but failed.\n\nCheck for the right balance of slang and clarity so everyone in the group chat gets it. Avoid being too obscure. Maybe end with a callout or a question to engage the group, like asking who else saw it or if they're still cringing.\n\nAlso, consider the flow: start with excitement, describe the event with humor, add emojis for emphasis, and conclude with a funny remark or a meme reference. Make sure to use line breaks and multiple emojis where appropriate to mimic how teens text.\n</think>\n\n**Group Chat Message:**  \n\nYOLO \ud83d\ude0e just had THE *vibes* at lunch \ud83d\ude02\ud83c\udf55\ud83d\udd25  \nSo, [Name] tried to be *lit* and do that \"Skibidi Toilet\" trend \ud83d\udebd\ud83c\udf00 but instead spilled ketchup on their shirt \ud83d\udc80\ud83d\ude02 now they\u2019re walking around like *beige* (cringe central) \ud83e\udd22.  \n\nThen [Another Name] attempted to flex their *rizz* by flirting with the lunch lady \ud83d\ude0e\ud83e\udd78 but she just gave them a look and said, \u201cYou wanna try again?\u201d \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\udc80  \n\nAnd don\u2019t even get me started on the *cheugy* cheese fries nobody ordered \ud83c\udf54\ud83d\ude2d. Someone took a bite and immediately regretted life.  \n\nWho else witnessed this chaos? \ud83d\udc40\ud83d\udd25 #LunchGoesHard #CheugyChaos \ud83e\udee0\ud83d\udca5  \n\n*(P.S.
