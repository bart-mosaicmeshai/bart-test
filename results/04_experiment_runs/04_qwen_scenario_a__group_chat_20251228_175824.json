  "response": "<think>\nOkay, the user wants me to text their group chat about what happened at lunch using Gen-Alpha slang and emojis. Let me start by recalling what Gen-Alpha slang is like. They're kids born around 2010 onwards, so they use a lot of internet slang, abbreviations, and maybe some TikTok trends.\n\nFirst, I need to think about common phrases. Words like \"lit,\" \"vibe,\" \"cheugy,\" \"skibidi,\" \"no cap,\" \"slay,\" \"simp,\" \"rizz,\" etc. Also, they might use a lot of emojis to convey tone. Maybe some popular ones like \ud83c\udf55, \ud83d\ude02, \ud83d\udc80, \ud83d\udc40, \ud83e\udd2f.\n\nThe user mentioned 2-3 sentences. So I need to keep it concise but still include the necessary elements. The main event at lunch\u2014maybe something funny or relatable. Let's say there was a funny moment with food, maybe someone tried to be cool but failed. \n\nLet me structure the first sentence: Start with a hook, like \"YOLO\" or \"No cap,\" then describe the event. Use emojis related to food and reactions. Second sentence could add more details or a joke, using more slang and emojis. Maybe mention someone's reaction or a trend they're following.\n\nCheck if I'm using the right emojis. For example, \ud83c\udf55 for pizza, \ud83d\ude02 for laughing, \ud83d\udc80 for something epic",
