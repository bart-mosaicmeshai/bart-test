  "response": "Okay, the user wants me to hype up their friend who got a good grade using Gen-Alpha slang and emojis, keeping it under 100 words. Let me start by recalling what Gen-Alpha slang is like. They use terms like \"slay,\" \"vibe,\" \"goated,\" maybe some abbreviations like \"fr\" for \"for real.\" Emojis are key here\u2014think sparkles, fire, party hats, maybe some animals like \ud83d\udc10 or \ud83e\udd85.\n\nFirst, I need to make it energetic and positive. Start with an attention-grabbing opener like \"Wow\" or \"OMG.\" Maybe something like \" Congrats on the W, fam! \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udd25\" Then mention the good grade specifically. Words like \"slayin\u2019 it\" or \"crushin\u2019 exams.\" Emphasize that they're killing it. Add some hype phrases like \"legend status\" or \"iconic.\" Include emojis related to success: \ud83c\udf1f, \ud83d\udcaf, \ud83d\udcab. Maybe a party animal like \ud83d\udc3c for study vibes? Or \ud83c\udf89 for celebration. \n\nNeed to keep it short, so each sentence should pack a punch. Maybe end with something encouraging for future success and some playful emojis. Check the word count. Let me draft a sample:\n\n\"OMG congrats on that A+ slay! \ud83c\udf1f\ud83d\udd25 You\u2019re absolutely goated rn, crushing it like a boss \ud83d\ude0e\ud83d\udcaf. Legend status unlocked \ud83d\ude80\ud83e\udd85\u2014keep vibin\u2019 that genius energy! \ud83c\udf89\ud83d\udc4f #Blessed\"\n\nWait, \"goated\" is spelled with a 't' right? Sometimes people use \"goated.\" Emojis: maybe add some more like \ud83c\udf93 for school, but since it's about the grade, maybe not necessary. Let me count words here. That's around 35 words. Maybe add another line to reach closer to 100 but keep it concise. Alternatively, maybe use more slang terms. \"Fr tho, you\u2019re on another level \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udd25 Flexing those brain gains \ud83d\udcaa\u2728\" Hmm, but need to stay under 100. Maybe combine sentences. Let me try another version:\n\n\"Yo, that grade\u2019s fire AF! \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25 Flexin\u2019 that A+ like it\u2019s nothin\u2019 \ud83c\udf1f You\u2019re slayin\u2019, fam\u2014legend vibes only \ud83e\udd85\ud83d\udcaf. Keep ballin\u2019 like this, you\u2019ll be the GOAT soon! \ud83c\udfc6\ud83c\udf89 #GrindPayoff\"\n\nThat's shorter. Maybe include more emojis. Let me check the word count again. Maybe add some exclamations and more emojis without making it too long. Also, use \"fr\" if possible. Maybe start with \"Fr tho,\" but need to keep it hype. Alternatively, \"OMG congrats on the W! \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udd25 That A+ is pure slay, you\u2019re crushing it like a pro \ud83d\udcaf\u2728. Legendary move rn \ud83e\udd85\u2014keep this energy flowin\u2019! \ud83c\udf89\ud83d\udca5 #Iconic\"\n\nHmm, \"pure slay\" might be better. Maybe add a study-related emoji like \ud83d\udcda? Or maybe not necessary. Need to ensure it's all hype and positive. Let me count words in the first example I had: \"OMG congrats on that A+ slay! \ud83c\udf1f\ud83d\udd25 You\u2019re absolutely goated rn, crushing it like a boss \ud83d\ude0e\ud83d\udcaf. Legend status unlocked \ud83d\ude80\ud83e\udd85\u2014keep vibin\u2019 that genius energy! \ud83c\udf89\ud83d\udc4f #Blessed\" That's 44 words. Maybe expand a bit more with another sentence or more emojis. Like adding \"Fr, you\u2019re on fire right now!\" but without exceeding the limit. Alternatively, use more slang like \"no cap\" or \"cop that W.\" Wait, the user specified Gen-Alpha, so terms like \"no cap\" are good. Maybe: \"No cap, you\u2019re cooking with gas! \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\ude80 That grade\u2019s fire AF\u2014legend mode activated \ud83e\udd85\ud83d\udcaf. Keep this energy, you\u2019re gonna be the GOAT! \ud83c\udfc6\ud83c\udf89 #Blessed\"\n\nThat's 37 words. Maybe combine elements. Let me try to hit around 70-80 words. Alternatively, just make sure it's under 100 and as hype as possible with the right slang and emojis. Maybe include a phrase like \"periodt\" or \"fam.\" Let me try another version: \n\n\"Yo, congrats on the W! \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udd25 That A+ is pure slay\u2014crushing exams like it\u2019s a walk in the park \ud83c\udf1f\ud83d\udc4f. You\u2019re on another level rn",
