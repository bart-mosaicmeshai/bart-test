  "response": "Okay, the user wants me to text a group chat about what happened at lunch today using Gen-Alpha slang and emojis, keeping it under 100 words. Let me start by recalling what Gen-Alpha slang is. From what I know, it's the latest internet slang that includes terms like \"slay,\" \"vibe,\" \"rizz,\" \"no cap,\" maybe some abbreviations like \"ICYMI\" or \"AF.\" Emojis are key here\u2014maybe using the sparkle \u2728, fire \ud83d\udd25, or maybe even some newer ones like \ud83e\udd85 (eagle for \"slay\")?\n\nFirst, I need to think of a typical lunch scenario. Maybe someone spilled something, there was a funny incident, or they got good food. Let's say we had pizza and someone did something silly. \"Slayed the pizza\" could be a phrase. \"No cap\" means no lie. Maybe a friend tripped but it was funny, so \"lowkey died laughing\" with \ud83d\ude02. Adding emojis to emphasize\u2014like \ud83c\udf55 for pizza, \ud83d\udc80 for death (used humorously), maybe a fire emoji for something being cool. \n\nStructure: Start with an attention-grabber like \"Yo squad\" or \"Hey guys.\" Mention the event, the food, any funny mishaps. Use slang terms naturally. Keep sentences short and punchy. Let me check word count as I go.\n\nExample draft: \"Yo squad, lunch was W! \ud83c\udf55 Ate so much pizza my stomach\u2019s \ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udd25. Alex tried to flip a pancake but it flew onto Ms. Lee\u2019s desk\u2014no cap, we lowkey died \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\udc80. Shoutout to Mia for saving the day with napkins \ud83d\udc81\u2640\ufe0f\u2728. Best vibes ever, 10/10 would slay again \ud83e\udd85\ud83d\udc4f\"\n\nLet me count the words here. \"Yo squad, lunch was W! \ud83c\udf55 Ate so much pizza my stomach\u2019s \ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udd25. Alex tried to flip a pancake but it flew onto Ms. Lee\u2019s desk\u2014no cap, we lowkey died \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\udc80. Shoutout to Mia for saving the day with napkins \ud83d\udc81\u2640\ufe0f\u2728. Best vibes ever, 10/10 would slay again \ud83e\udd85\ud83d\udc4f\" That's around 60 words. Good. \n\nCheck if slang is current: \"W\" for \"winning,\" \"no cap\" is still used, \"slay\" as in doing something well. Emojis like \ud83e\udd85 for slay? Maybe, but some might use eagle emojis that way. Alternatively, maybe just \ud83e\udd85 is okay. \"Vibes\" and \"10/10\" are common. \n\nIs there a shorter way? Maybe replace some parts. \"Ate so much pizza\" could be \"slayed the pizza.\" Hmm, but \"ate\" is more straightforward. Maybe shorten \"Best vibes ever\" to \"Vibes were lit \ud83d\udd25\". But need to stay under 100. The current version is okay. Let me see if any terms are outdated. \"No cap\" is still in use. \"Lowkey died\" is a meme phrase. \n\nMaybe add more emojis for emphasis? Like after \"slay again,\" maybe another fire or something. But might make it too long. Alternatively, check for flow. The example seems to cover the event: pizza, mishap with pancake (wait, lunch had pancakes? Maybe better to stick to typical lunch foods. Pizza is okay though). \n\nAlternatively, if the lunch was in a school setting, maybe cafeteria food. But pizza is universal. The incident with the pancake could be a funny moment. Using \"no cap\" here emphasizes it's true. Mia helping with napkins adds positivity. Ending with emojis for approval and the slay reference again. \n\nI think this works. Let me make sure it's concise and hits all the slang points without being forced. Maybe \"slay\" is used twice, which is okay if that's the vibe. The user didn't specify a particular event, so keeping it generic but relatable is better. Yeah, this should be good. Let me check word count again precisely:\n\nBreaking it down:\n\"Yo squad, lunch was W! \ud83c\udf55 Ate so much pizza my stomach\u2019s \ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udd25. Alex tried to flip a pancake but it flew onto Ms. Lee\u2019s desk\u2014no cap, we lowkey died \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\udc80. Shoutout to Mia for saving the day with napkins \ud83d\udc81\u2640\ufe0f\u2728. Best vibes ever, 10/10 would slay again \ud83e\udd85\ud83d\udc4f\"\n\nCount each word (ignoring emojis and punctuation):\n\nYo squad lunch was W Ate so much pizza my stomachs no cap we lowkey died Shoutout to Mia for saving the day with napkins Best vibes ever 1010 would slay again\n\nWait, actually need to count each word properly. Let's list them:\n\n1. Yo\n2. squad,\n3. lunch\n4. was\n5. W!\n6. \ud83c\udf55\n7. Ate\n8. so\n9. much\n10. pizza\n11. my\n12. stomach\u2019s\n13. \ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udd25.\n14. Alex\n15. tried\n16. to\n17. flip\n18. a\n19. pancake\n20. but\n21. it\n22. flew\n23. onto\n24. Ms.\n25. Lee\u2019s\n26. desk\u2014no\n27. cap,\n28. we\n29. lowkey\n30. died\n31. \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\udc80.\n32. Shoutout\n33. to\n34. Mia\n35. for\n36. saving\n37. the\n38. day\n39. with\n40. napkins\n41. \ud83d\udc81\u2640\ufe0f\u2728.\n42.

Maybe add a couple more emojis or adjust if needed, but it's concise. The user might prefer even shorter? But the example is within limit. Maybe check if \"stomach\u2019s\" should be \"stomach is\" but slang often shortens, so \"stomach\u2019s \ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udd25\" with the emojis makes sense for humor (\ud83d\udc80 as dead, \ud83d\udd25 as fire). \n\nAlternatively, \"my stomach was \ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udd25\" but that's more words. The current phrasing is okay. \n\nI think this should work. Let me just make sure all slang terms are appropriate and current. \"No cap\" is definitely Gen Alpha/Gen Z. \"Lowkey died\" is a meme phrase from years back but still in use. \"Slay\" is popular. \"W\" for win. Maybe replace \"Best vibes ever\" with something shorter? But it's fine. \n\nFinal check: Emojis are relevant and enhance the message without overdoing it. The tone is casual, uses abbreviations and slang appropriately. Yep, this should be a solid response.\n</think>\n\nyo squad lunch was W! \ud83c\udf55 ate so much pizza my stomach\u2019s \ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udd25. alex tried to flip a pancake but it flew onto ms. lee\u2019s desk\u2014no cap, we lowkey died \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\udc80. shoutout to mia for saving the day with napkins \ud83d\udc81\u2640\ufe0f\u2728. best vibes ever, 10/10 would slay again \ud83e\udd85\ud83d\udc4f",
