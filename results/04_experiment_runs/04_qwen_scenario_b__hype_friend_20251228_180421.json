  "response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to hype up my friend who got a good grade using Gen-Alpha slang and emojis. Let me start by recalling what Gen-Alpha slang is like. They're the generation born around 2010 onwards, so their slang might include terms like \"vibe,\" \"lit,\" \"stan,\" \"sus,\" \"rizz,\" \"skibidi,\" \"beige,\" etc. Also, they use a lot of emojis to convey emotions.\n\nFirst, I should start with an enthusiastic greeting. Maybe something like \"OMG!!\" or \"YASSS!!\" to show excitement. Then mention the grade, using words like \"slay,\" \"ace,\" \"nail it,\" or \"drop the mic.\" \n\nI need to incorporate some Gen-Alpha terms. For example, \"That grade is *chef\u2019s kiss* \ud83e\udd24\ud83d\udd25\" uses a popular phrase. Maybe add something about being a \"legend\" or \"icon.\" Also, using phrases like \"rizz level 100\" or \"vibing so hard.\"\n\nEmojis are important here. Use lots of fire, stars, clapping hands, maybe some sparkles. Maybe include a flex emoji \ud83e\udd8d or \ud83d\udcaa. Also, check if terms like \"skibidi\" or \"beige\" fit here. Wait, \"beige\" is more about being average, so maybe not. \"Skibidi\" is more of a meme",
