  "response": "<think>\nOkay, the user wants me to hype up their friend for getting a good grade using Gen Alpha slang and emojis, keeping it brief. Let me start by recalling what Gen Alpha slang is like. They're known for terms like \"vibe,\" \"lit,\" \"slay,\" \"goat,\" and maybe some TikTok phrases.\n\nFirst, I need to make sure the message is energetic and positive. Maybe start with a strong emoji like \ud83c\udf89 or \ud83d\udcaf. Then use words that resonate with younger generations. Words like \"GOAT\" (Greatest Of All Time) could be good. Also, \"slay\" is a common term for doing something well.\n\nI should include some popular emojis related to school or success, like \ud83d\udcda, \ud83c\udf93, \ud83d\udcaa. Maybe add a bit of humor with something like \"teacher\u2019s pet \ud83d\ude02\" but keep it light. Need to make sure the message isn't too long. Let me piece it together: start with an emoji, mention the grade, use slang terms, add some emojis, and maybe a playful jab. Check for brevity and correct usage.\n</think>\n\n\ud83c\udf89\ud83d\udd25 A+ slay! You\u2019re the GOAT \ud83d\udc10 of the class, flexing that brain \ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\udcda. Teachers are *literally* crying \ud83d\ude02 (in a good way). Keep that vibe, legend! \ud83c\udf93\u2728",
