  "response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to hype up my friend who just got a good grade using Gen Alpha slang and emojis. Let me start by recalling what Gen Alpha slang is like. They're the generation born around 2010 onwards, so their slang might include terms like \"vibe,\" \"lit,\" \"flex,\" \"no cap,\" \"cheugy,\" \"skibidi,\" \"rizz,\" etc. Also, they use a lot of emojis and maybe some internet acronyms.\n\nFirst, I should start with an enthusiastic greeting. Maybe something like \"NO CAP!!\" to emphasize excitement. Then mention the grade, using terms like \"flex\" or \"slay.\" Emojis would be important here\u2014maybe \ud83c\udf89, \ud83d\udcaf, \ud83e\udd47, \ud83d\ude80, \ud83d\udcab, etc.\n\nI need to make sure the message is energetic and uses phrases that resonate with younger generations. Maybe include some references to being \"lit\" or \"on fleek.\" Also, add some encouragement for future achievements. Perhaps use \"stay lit\" or \"keep that grind.\"\n\nWait, I should check if some terms are still relevant. For example, \"cheugy\" is more about being outdated, so maybe avoid that. \"Rizz\" is about charm, but maybe not directly related to grades. Maybe focus on terms like \"vibe,\" \"slay,\" \"flex,\" \"lit,\" \"grind.\"\n\nAlso, using phrases like \"drop the mic\" or \"owning it.\" Maybe add some emojis related to school, like \ud83d\udcda, \ud83c\udf93, \ud83e\udde0, but also celebration ones. Let me structure it step by step.\n\nStart with an exclamation, mention the grade, use slang terms, add emojis, encourage them, maybe a joke about studying or flexing. Make sure it's not too long but still enthusiastic. Avoid anything that might be outdated or misunderstood. Maybe throw in \"skibidi\" for fun, though I'm not sure if that's Gen Alpha. Alternatively, use \"beige\" as in \"that's so beige,\" but maybe not appropriate here.\n\nLet me draft a sample: \n\n\"No cap, you just flexed the \ud83d\udcaf on that test!! \ud83c\udf89\ud83d\udd25 Your brain is ON FIRE \ud83d\udd25\ud83e\udde0, slaying all the subjects like it\u2019s a skibidi challenge! \ud83d\ude80\u2728 Keep that grind, my dude/dudette\u2014your future is looking lit AF. \ud83c\udf1f\ud83d\udcda Let\u2019s gooo!!! \ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\udca5\"\n\nWait, \"skibidi\" might be more of a meme term from recent trends, but maybe acceptable. Alternatively, replace with something else if unsure. Also, check for correct emoji usage. Maybe add a trophy or something. Also, use \"my guy\" or \"my girl\" as part of the hype.\n\nAnother pass: \n\n\"NO CAP YOU JUST SLAYED THAT TEST \ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25 YOUR BRAIN IS SO VIBEY \ud83e\udde0\u2728 LETS GOOOO!!! \ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf89 KEEP THAT GRIND AND STAY LIT AF \ud83d\ude0e\ud83d\udcda YOU\u2019RE THE BOMB DOT COM \ud83d\udca3\ud83d\udca5\"\n\nHmm, maybe too much exclamation. Balance between excitement and readability. Maybe include a bit of humor or reference to studying hard. Also, use \"cheugy\" as a contrast? Not sure.\n\nFinalize with emojis that match each part: test result (\ud83d\udcaf, \ud83d\udcda), celebration (\ud83c\udf89, \ud83c\udf89, \ud83d\udd25), brain power (\ud83e\udde0, \ud83d\udca1), future success (\ud83d\ude80, \ud83c\udf1f). Maybe add some clapping hands or party popper emojis.\n</think>\n\n\"NO CAP, YOU JUST FLEXED THE \ud83d\udcaf ON THAT TEST!! \ud83c\udf89\ud83d\udd25 YOUR BRAIN IS ON FIRE \ud83d\udd25\ud83e\udde0, SLAYING ALL THE SUBJECTS LIKE IT\u2019S A SKIBIDI CHALLENGE! \ud83d\ude80\u2728 KEEP THAT GRIND, MY GUY\u2014YOUR FUTURE IS LIT AF. \ud83c\udf1f\ud83d\udcda LET\u2019S GOOO!!! \ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\udca5 YOU\u2019RE THE BOMB DOT COM \ud83d\udca3\ud83d\udca5\"  \n\n(Throws in a \ud83e\udd47 for good measure and a \ud83e\udde0\ud83d\udd25 for that extra *vibe*.)",
